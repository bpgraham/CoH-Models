# CoH-Models
Software for modelling short-term plasticity at synapses, particularly the calyx of Held.

The Matlab code in the Kv33-Models folder was used to generate the modelling results in Figure 6 of the paper "Kv3.3 subunits control presynaptic action potential waveform and neurotransmitter release at a central excitatory synapse" by Richardson et al. in eLife 2022;11:e75219 DOI:10.7554/eLife.75219.
